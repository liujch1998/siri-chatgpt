## Installation

1. First, you need to have an iPhone (or iPad; sorry Android users!) running iOS 13 or later. Make sure you have the Shortcuts app installed. Make sure you have Siri enabled and listening for "Hey Siri".

1. You also need an OpenAI API key. This can be obtained from <https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys>.

1. Download the latest version of our shortcut. You can find the link in the "Download Links" section above. Open the Shortcuts app and you should find the downloaded shortcut.

1. Rename the shortcut to "chat GPT". (You may also use any name you like that Siri can recognize, but do not use "ChatGPT" (i.e. without the space), because Siri won't recognize this word.)

1. Open the shortcut. You will see a text box at the very beginning. Paste your OpenAI API key into this text box. Click the Done button to save.

1. Now say "Hey Siri, chat GPT".

## Usage

1. Say "Hey Siri, chat GPT".

1. It should say, "I am ChatGPT. How may I assist you?" Now you can start chatting with it.

1. After reading out ChatGPT's response to your query, Siri will immediately start listening to your next query.

1. When you're finished, simply say "Goodbye" and end your conversation.
